# Exploratory Data Analysis On Public Health Data and Life Expectancy with Machine Learning

In this individual project, we explored a life expectancy dataset compiled from the World Health Organisation. We identified key factors that influence life expectancy, we predicted life expectancy using a regression model, and we provided insights for policy-making. 

We first cleaned and prepared the data, then we did a statistical analysis of the various fields by finding their mean, median and mode, and we visualised our findings using appropriate graphs and charts. 

We then built a linear regression model to help us predict life expectancy using scikit-learn. This is followed by a k-fold cross validation to assess the robustness of our predictive model. Lastly, we did some feature engineering to improve our current model.
